            <p class="subject-content f-4 text-align-center"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> We believe putting sustainability at the core of everything we do. We feel it’s important to leverage our influence and help align economic development with environmental care and social responsibility. <br><br>We also believe in the future of shared commercial and creative platforms and the power of the community over competition. We aim to build a business model functioning with a transparent supply chain in which each fragment respects both the present-day environment and the essential connection between humanity and nature. <br><br>As a consumer-oriented business, we are responsible for everything we make. Therefore, our number one priority is to minimise waste in every step for the product lifecycle. From design, the production of raw materials, manufacturing, storage, transport, marketing, sale, use, reuse and recycling - we take responsibility for what we create. <br><br>Fashion is considered the biggest needless pollutant to the environment sector. With some concerning statistics forecasting that by 2030, the industry’s water consumption will grow by 50 per cent. We believe we can break this vicious cycle by conceptualising our business on slow steady growth and sustainable production, prioritising quality over quantity at all times, diversifying into product categories which are sustainable by nature. We are committed to research, use and utilise all of our resources in supporting an ethical and socially responsible business entity. <br><br></span></p>

            <p class="subject-content f-4 text-align-center"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Nearly 500 million people are involved in the textile and garment industry. Roughly 10% of that number are the garment workers and 85% of them are women. In the given market standards garment workers are generally paid slightly above the minimum wage. For some, that’s as little as 11p per hour. We produce our garments in Bulgaria where we have a sampling unit and a vast network of factories and workshops we partner with. Today, garment and textile production remain one of the major industries in Bulgaria, employing thousands. We have set up a standard to pay at least 10% above the regular wage and this varies between orders to up to 30% more. <br><br>Most importantly, we know our people personally; we visit them on a regular basis, at the very least, 5 times a year. <br><br></span></p>

            <p class="subject-content f-4 text-align-center"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> The garment supply chain is probably one of the most complex aspects of fashion. Currently, it’s practically impossible to provide 100% transparency but we keep our supply chain as sustainable as possible. All of our suppliers take environmental and social standards seriously and are based in the EU or the UK. We make around 60% of our garments in house and the rest in local responsible manufacturers we visit regularly. We aim to progress with transparency of our operations. One of the reasons we started working on creating an alternative business model that functions within a closed-loop ecosystem built by ourselves. The only way to track the supply chain from field to final product. In Gene, every product is done after extremely careful research and development process. In the clothing and the homeware categories, we use only natural fibre, mainly silk and cotton, but also linen, hemp and bamboo. We also use innovative man-made fibres, like Tencel, known as the sustainable brand of viscose. The fibre also originates from the renewable raw material wood and is created by photosynthesis. It is brought to life in a closed-loop production process, the water used is recycled and fewer chemicals are required during the manufacture. It goes without saying that the trees used for this product are managed under strict regulations to make sure that there is no harm being made to our planet. <br><br></span></p>

            <p class="subject-content f-4 text-align-center"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Clothing's greatest environmental impact happens during the care cycle. It may surprise you that care — washing, drying, ironing and dry cleaning — uses more energy and toxins than raising fibre, spinning, dyeing, manufacturing or transportation. <br><br>One of the simplest ways to minimise the impact of care is to machine wash clothes in cold water, using non-petroleum, eco-friendly soaps. For silk this needs to be a hand wash, it will save the garment for decades. Try these simple steps <br><br>1. Switch to Cold Water <br>This simple act can cut your energy impact by up to 90 per cent. When our labels call for machine washing, they call for cold water. <br><br>2. Choose Products from Plants Not Petroleum <br>Chemicals and dyes aren't renewable, and most don't biodegrade. Look up anything you can't pronounce – you can Google all the ingredients. <br><br>3. Steam Instead of Iron <br>Steaming saves energy and freshens clothes, extending the time between dry cleanings. <br><br>4. Hand Wash Instead of Dry Clean <br>Read care labels and you'll be surprised at how many fibres – wool, silk, cashmere, mohair – can be hand washed. <br><br>5. Go to a Green Dry Cleaner <br>The nasty facts about perc, a known carcinogen, make going out of your way to a greener cleaner worth it. If you can, bring a reusable dry-cleaning bag or ask your cleaner to skip the plastic. And bring back your hangers to recycle. Most of our clothing can be washed at home and air-dried. <br><br></span></p>
