            <p class="subject-content f-4 text-align-center"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The future-proof fibre of silk cocoons is a long-standing tradition in Bulgarian culture. In fact, there’s plenty of data suggesting silk production existed in Bulgaria since at least VII-XII AD. <br><br>Back in late XIX AD, sericulture in Bulgaria grew immensely - with the country being a leader in Europe. The textile industry flourished and until the 1990s this small Balkan country produced huge amounts of silk fibres and garments. After the Berlin wall fell, all silk manufacturing in the country ceased. Factories were sold and turned into commercial facilities. <br><br>Here at GENE, we use silk in most of our products, sourced from mainly from surplus or dead stock fabrics within the EEA and the UK. <br><br>In 2019 we began the groundwork to revive silk production in Bulgaria. The project aimed to build an innovative business ecosystem that is entirely transparent from field to final product. Since most of the land used for sericulture is not suitable for other agricultural crops, the silk industry contributes to environmental sustainability through eco-friendly production processes, increases green cover, helps soil conservation and prevents soil erosion. <br><br>And, since sericulture is labour intensive, carbon emissions during production are minimal. Additionally, female participation in the sericulture and silk industry is about 60%, so by introducing this industry to more communities, more women and family members are able to generate substantial income for the family.  Many of the studies undertaken in China, Thailand and India proved that the sericulture and silk industry are an essential tool for empowering women and improving gender equality. <br><br></span></p>

            <p class="subject-content f-4 text-align-center"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">THE ROSE VALLEY in the Kazanlak area is one of the oldest inhabited regions in Bulgaria. <br><br>Historians believe that Damascena roses have been cultivated there for over a thousand years. During the 16th century under Ottoman rule, roses were commercially grown for their special properties and a new town known as Kazanlak (Kazan is the Turkish word for boiler) was established. The nearby valley provided the perfect climate for growing roses, thereby becoming the finest rose oil-producing region in the world. <br><br>In September 2014, the European Commission approved Bulgarian rose oil as a new Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). Our GENE roses grow organically without fertilisers and pesticides, in a small village hidden in the Rose Valley region. <br><br>The land and the distillery we partner with have been growing and harvesting roses for the past 20 years. So, we easily can track the process from field to final product. <br><br>We use rose oil from two different varieties of rose-bearing plants; the white rose-Alba and the classic rose-Damascena. <br><br>We have focused mainly on the white rose-alba oil because of its powerful therapeutic qualities. It is much more soothing and has shown to regenerate the mind on a psychic level, helping with insomnia, anxiety and general stress. The aroma of the Alba is gentle and feminine and much more subtle that the Damascena. It’s also more luxurious, requiring at least a third more petals than rose-Damascena to distil the same amount of oil. <br><br>Each year we take part in harvesting the roses, which only happens from mid-May till Mid-June when the rose bushes are in full bloom. Alongside hand pickers from all around the country, we enjoy this magical, centuries-old tradition. Harvesting the flowers starts at sunrise when the oil yield is at its highest and is completed before noon while the dew is still on the flowers. <br><br>The picked flowers are placed in sacks and immediately transported to our nearby organic distillery amid distilled by the end of the day. Each product in our GENE range has a drop of the magical rose oil or is a direct by-product of its production, such as the rose water sprays. <br><br></span></p>

Not, just those based in our head office. Specifically, GENE celebrates women who refuse to let looks confine her to trends and sacrifice self-value. We’re abandoning the illusory search for perfection. It is a brand aimed at evolving in a new era of beauty that sees the world as imperfect, unfinished and transient. <br><br>GENE is fiercely female-focused, but we’re not about empowering women to fill the classic paradigm that restricted them in the first place. <br><br>Serving women with the single purpose of providing comfort is what GENE has always been about, whether this comfort is dressing a personality without depending on social standards or offering a universal beauty product born of ethical innovation and product superiority. <br><br></span></p>
